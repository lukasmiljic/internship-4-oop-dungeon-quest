## Dungeon Crawler Game
Turn based console dungeon crawler game made using OOP principles.
### Hero classes
At the beginning of the game you pick your Hero's class. You can choose from 
* Gladiator - Well balanced class with medium HP and Damage. Can use his special move Rage Attack to deal more damage for the price of his own HP.
* Marksman - Has more HP than average but his Damage is weaker. Which he makes up for with his Stun Attack and Critical Attack abilites.
* Enchanter - Magical character with the highest Damage but also the lowest HP. His Mana drains with every attack and if it hits zero it needs a turn to refill, he also has the ability to revive himself once.

### Monster types
Your Hero will have to face different types of Monsters:
* Goblin - Weakest and most common enemy with the lowest HP and Damage
* Brute - Stronger type of Monster with more HP and Damage
* Witch - Magical enemy with the most HP and Damage. Very dangerous.
   
### Rounds and battle system
You will face 10 rounds of battle. Battling consists of a Rock Paper Scissor type game where you pick one attack type, which can be Direct, Side or Counter. Direct beats Side , Side beats Counter and Counter beats Direct. The monster will also pick one attack type at random. Who ever wins takes his turn. If you manage to survive all 10 rounds you win the game.
